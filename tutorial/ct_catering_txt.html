     <h1>Catering</h1>
     <p>Curbside Thai brings the rich flavor of Thailand to 
     North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35 
     years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers 
     that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte 
     with our modern mobile food truck.</p>
     
     <p>This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy 
     paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various 
     mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from 
     11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and 
     11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the 
     difference! If you can't get away from your desk, 
     Curbside Thai will deliver.</p>
     
     Contact us to cater your next party and experience 
     what Carolina Traveler calls the finest Asian food 
     on or off the streets of Charlotte.
